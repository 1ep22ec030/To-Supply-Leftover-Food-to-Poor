# To-Supply-Leftover-Food-to-Poor
A system to collect and supply leftover food from individuals and organizations to poor and needy people, reducing waste and helping fight hunger.
Welcome to My project — To Supply Leftover Food to the Poor. This system is built in Salesforce to help distribute surplus food quickly and efficiently.
# Account & Setup
I start by creating a Salesforce Developer Account and setting up our workspace for customization.
# Custom Objects & Tabs
A custom object is created to store all food supply details, and tabs are added for easy access
# Lightning App
Next, I designed a Lightning App, bringing all tools together in one interface.
# Fields & Automation
Custom fields capture details like food type, quantity, and drop-off point. Automation through flows and triggers ensures fast updates.
# Users & Groups
Profiles and user accounts manage access, while public groups make team collaboration easy.
# Reports & Dashboards
I created report types, reports, and dashboards to track supply and delivery operations.
# Sharing Rules & Home Page
Sharing rules ensure the right people see the right data, and the home page is customized for quick access.
# Conclusion
With this Salesforce system, leftover food can be delivered faster and more effectively to those in need — making every meal count.
